This CMS provides you with a straightforward and efficient way to manage the products available in your store. Whether you need to add new products, remove outdated ones, or temporarily suspend items from your catalog, this system has you covered.

## Introduction
My CMS simplifies this process by offering an intuitive admin panel that puts you in control of your product list.

## Features

Add Products with Ease
Adding new products to your store has never been easier. With my CMS, you can seamlessly input all the necessary details for each product in real time preview, including:
Product Name: Clearly identify your products by name.
Category: Organize your products by assigning them to specific categories.
Description: Provide detailed and enticing product descriptions.
Price: Set competitive prices for each item.
Images: Showcase your products with stunning images.

Remove Products Permanently
When it's time to say goodbye to a product for good, our CMS lets you remove it from your catalog permanently. This keeps your product listings tidy and up-to-date, ensuring that customers only see available items.

Suspend or Activate Products
Sometimes, you might need to temporarily suspend a product from your store, perhaps due to low stock or seasonal availability. Our system allows you to easily suspend and reactivate products as needed. This flexibility ensures that you're always in control of your product offerings.
